## **Platformer based on SFML**
A platformer (also called a platform game, and sometimes a jump 'n' run game) is a sub-genre of action video games in which the core objective is to move the player character between points in an environment. Platform games are characterized by levels with uneven terrain and suspended platforms of varying height that require jumping and climbing to traverse.

# **The idea of platformer**
I spend a lot of time playing games, so I thought why don't I try what it's like to create my own game? I decided to use SFML as a basis, because I really wanted to make a game in C++. I didn't have a goal to create some kind of unique game, my goal was to study the SFML library and the basics of game programming, at the same time to improve my programming skills in general.

# **Tasks that I have completed**
Since this was my first full-fledged project, there were many difficulties. The most difficult thing was to make the physics of the game, here you need to have knowledge of mathematics and understand how games are developed. For a long time I have been trying to organize the physics of attraction correctly. As a result, I was able to solve this problem. I learned how to load various textures, studied how the user can interact with the game, set music and voice acting, and also organized the volume response. As a result, I was able to implement all my plans in a month.

# **Plot**
Since the game was not intended to be full-fledged, then the plot in it can be described in one sentence - bring an apple to the mushroom, for which the mushroom will thank the hero.  I did not develop the plot and add new mechanics, because I wanted to study how they are made in general, and further development of the project is a repetition of what I have already learned, plus it requires more pictures, which means an artist is required.
If there are any suggestions for the development of the project, I am ready to discuss them.

# **Program structure**
My program is divided into classes thematically. The Game class is responsible for the game itself and its plot, drawing game textures. The Internal_menu class is responsible for in-game settings. The Map class contains a map of the game. The Menu class implements the main menu that we see when starting the game. The Player class is responsible for loading the character, his interaction with the world. The settings class is the class responsible for setting up the game from the main menu.
